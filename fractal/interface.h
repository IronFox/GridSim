		\brief Texture space class to roll a planar texture around a sphere
		
		The RollSpace class can be used to project a seamless planar texture onto the surface of a sphere in such a way that the observer believes
		thet the texture is actually fixed on the geometry. The object will produce a system that can be loaded into a graphics context to use the vertex
		space coordinates as texture coordinates.
		This illusion requires the following conditions to be met:<br />
		<ul>
		<li>The texture must be seamless. Large texture coordinates are used</li>
		<li>The texture should be roughly equal colored to not create ugly patterns on larger views</li>
		<li>The used texture range (the visual size of one repeated pattern) should be below 1% of the sphere's size or the illusion will become obvious</li>
		<li>The used clip-size must be a multiple of any used texture range or odd texture jumps will occur</li>
		</ul>

Extended border system:
Children contain part of their parents vertex data to adapt to level of detail changes (necessary due to parent vertex degeneration).
These vertices will be placed after the standard inner vertices in the following pattern:

[core vertices][edge0,parent0, length=(2<<(exponent-1))-1][edge0,parent1,length=(2<<exponent-2))-1]...[edge1,parent0][edge1,parent1]...[edge2,parent0]...
Total vertex volume along one edge: (exponent-1)^2




Override system:
The system may look odd but it works (though perhaps not perfectly)
Override priority is added to normal priority by a setPriority() invocation that determines that not all its edges have been synchronized.
As such it assigns additional priority (its own priority in fact) to the next available parents (and their parents, recursively) of the missing
neighbor(s). Since the project() method is inherently invoked in a sub-optimal order in regards to override priorities, two scenarios commonly
occur:

a) (prior case) the segment receives additional priority ahead of its respective project() (and thus setPriority()) invocation.
The Visibility::Override flag is set, thus preventing it from resetting its current priority value. It will, however, clear the flag.
Should the respective segment be considered visible by itself, then the override priority will be overwritten with its local priority.

b) (successive case) the segment receives additional priority after its respective project() invocation. Subdivision can no longer take place
during this frame, however the increased priority will take effect during the next subdivision.
Other than that, this case behaves just like case a), though delayed until the next frame.

Case b) may put considerably more priority on a surface segment than case a) if the respective segment is both visible and in demand.
Both effects do not last longer than two frames. The imbalance effect is thus considered minor.
